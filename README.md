install polyvore maryland dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dnepozitek/maryland-polyvore-images/data

place it into same folder as classifier so as to not interfere with intellisense, also code expects it to be in that location.

create .env file with field DIRNAME which contains absolute path to classifier folder on your computer with pattern DIRNAME=(previous folders)\\\\classifier

get your directories.json from me, create pending.json and results.json as empty arrays inside data folder
